# react-boilerplate
Includes React, Parcel, and ESLint.

Feel free to grab this and modify to fit your usages, this is the basic starting point that I use for all my React projects.

## Getting started
1. Clone the repo
2. Run ```yarn start``` from the repo's directory
3. Open ```http://localhost:1234``` in your browser
4. If all goes well, you should see "Hello world!"
